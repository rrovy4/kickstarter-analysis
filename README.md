# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This project assists in analyzing data on how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to comb through wide range of related data, and try to analyze projects based on their outcomes.

## Analysis and Challenges
Examined the raw source data, understood the requirements, utilized available excel formulas, plotted relevant graphs that tell appropriate story related to data.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
May and June seem to be the best months for launch

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Less than 1000 are the most successful, while any between 45000 to 49999 have all been a failure.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Manual editing of formulas can be tricky. Apart from that, no issues experienced.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. May and June are the best months for launch
2. October has least cancellations

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
Less than 1000 are the most successful, while any between 45000 to 49999 have all been a failure.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
1. Currency conversion not mentioned
2. Some data does have blanks

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
1. Can calculate various ratios
2. Group projects by financial category, for priority sake
3. Group by Country
